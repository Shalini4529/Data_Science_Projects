Business have started using data and text mining to analyze customer data to improve and discover new insights. Text mining is relatively new technology 
and uses various techniques such as categorization, entity extraction, sentiment analysis. Its ability to extract the useful information and hidden knowledge

Text mining is gaining far more importance than ever and being used increasingly in different business applications. Organizing huge amount of unstructured 
textual data, condensing it in to valuable knowledge and predicting valuable information are the key roles of text mining application.
In this project, text mining techniques are used to identify, investigate, predict and evaluate important features from complaint text database. Binary classification 
can be used to predict the likelihood that a complaint will not be disputed. In order to forecast the topic to which a complaint will belong to, multi-class classification 
will be explored. Topic modelling is also an option but here the topic is generated by the model. An attempt is made to find the good classifiers for customer complaint narrative.
